# Java-Training-Exam-Oracle
If you read about the exam on the web, you may see information about the older 
names for the exam. The name changes are shown in Figure I.1. Hereâ€™s what happened. 
Back when Sun Microsystems owned Java, they used to have two exams. The SCJA (Sun 
Certified Java Associate) was meant for new programmers and the SCJP (Sun Certified Java 
Programmer) was meant for those who wanted broader knowledge. When Oracle bought 
Sun Microsystems, they renamed all of the exams from Sun to Oracle, giving us the OCJA 
(Oracle Certified Java Associate) and OCJP (Oracle Certified Java Programmer).
